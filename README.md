I am currently a junior at Lehigh University, working on a major in journalism and a double minor in creative writing and psychology. It's safe to call me a music obssesive with a passion for playing guitar, ukulele, drums, and piano. With my free time, if I'm not behind the lens of my Canon 70D setting up a photo shoot, I'm probably in my room doodling my favorite childhood cartoons, writing in my journal, or burning through my list of must see movies. I'm a DJ and the music director for 91.3 WLVR Bethlehem, an Assistant Editor of Lifestyle for Lehigh's newspaper, The Brown and White, and am an active promoter of vinyl records.
